1. I removed duplicates; there were a total of 26 duplicates which I removed.
2. I replaced M and S with Married and Single in the status column and Male and Female for M and F in the Gender column.
3. Used nested if to convert Age into the Age bracket column (for visualization purposes).
4. Created a pivot table and a column chart to look at data: Gender vs. Income. Does making more money influence your decision to buy bikes?
5. Created another 2 pivot tables: Customer Commute with who purchased a bike and Customer Age bracket vs. Purchased bike.
6. I copied all the charts to the dashboard sheet, and using the gridlines option in view, I made gridlines disappear.
